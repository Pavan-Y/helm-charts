#issue with our nginx-chart     if we install it as release-1 and we install with another as release-2
#ERROR - as our deployment metadata name is statically defined, so it already exists ERROR.

so metadata name should be dynamic  =>  {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx

#we can access other as well...
-> Release.Name     Release.Namespace      Release.IsUpgrade      Release.IsInstall     Release.Revision      Release.Service

#same way we can refer other attributes such as
Chart.Name      Chart.ApiVersion    Values.replicaCount     Values.image
#even details of k8s cluster
Capabilities.KubeVersion    Capabilities.HelmVersion    Capabilities.GitCommit

#As we can see expect Values.attributes every other starting with Capital letter(coz they're In-Built.)



## Verifyig charts

    1. Linting(format check)
        -> helm lint ./nginx-chart
        # 1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed
    2. Verify Template (making sure proper values is placed)
        -> helm template hello-world ./nginx-chart      #here hello-world is release name
        # prints all yml files check them..
        #--debug for verbose
    3. Dry run
        #let's say we writtern container instead of containers in deployment
        #this will not be covered in lint/template check as this k8s format, so dry run helps here..
        -> helm install hello-world ./nginx-chart --dry-run
