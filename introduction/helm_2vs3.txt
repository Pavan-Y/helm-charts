Significant changes in 3 compared to 2

1.0     Feb 2016
2.0     Nov 2016 
3.0     Nov 2019

helm 2.0:
    tiller a software acted as middle man bw heml cli and k8s 
    -> this is used as there's no role based access control, custom resource defintions..

heml 3.0:
    -> they're added in k8s and this tiller was removed[helm 3.0]
    -> helm is directly contacting k8s.
    -> this improved RBAC security[user created in k8s, same rules whatever tool they use[can be helm or something]]
    -> '3 way strategic merge patch' added here

#ex. to understand 3 way strategic merge patch
install (rev1), upgrade(rev2)
    -> we can easily go back to old revisions
    but what if we made some changes to object manually(either applying by changes in yml, or editing object directly)
    helm has no idea about these changes. if we try to rollback it checks revision and feels no changes as there's 
    only 1 revision         (there'll be 2 if we did helm upgrade)

so in helm3 this was taken care.
    -> checks the current revision , the chart we want to revert to, live state of objects  [ 3 way]
    -> so this will preserve even those manual changes
    -> even in upgrade also helm2 will not pickup manual changes(just takes up from previous revision)
