Components in helm:

    cli -> to perform actions(installation of charts,.........)
    charts -> collection of files (all instrutions helm needs to create req. objects)
    release - single installation of an app using helm chart [when chart is applied, release is created]
    revision - multiple revisions per release (like versioning also referred as snapshots of app)

helm saves metadata(releases installed, charts used, revision state) as k8s secrets. [survives as long as k8s cluster survives]

various charts available in helm repo(public) of various apps. can download and deploy



-> helm install release_name chart_name

ex: helm install my-site bitnami/wordpress

#release name is required coz we can install multiple releases based on same chart
    helm install my-second-site bitnami/wordpress


different repositories available for helm charts(appscode, truecharts, bitnami, community operators)
#all these listed their charts in a single location Artifact hub(artifacthub.io)
